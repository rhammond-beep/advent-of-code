Gardening Group Fun

Calculate the total price of the fencing between specific groups which is defined as: "PA", where P = perimeter and A = area

To make this somewhat more complicated, it is perfectly possible to have nested regions, assuming a plabt of a given type is completely enclosed within some given outer region.

If this is the case, the outer region's perimeter must include the sum of it's inner boundaries. (This feels really recursive)
