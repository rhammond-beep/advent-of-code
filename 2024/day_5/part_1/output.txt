final map: 
map[
	13:[97 61 29 47 75 53] 
	29:[75 97 53 61 47] 
	47:[97 75] 
	53:[47 75 61 97] 
	61:[97 47 75] 
	75:[97]
]

75,47,61,53,29
97,61,53,29,13
75,29,13
75,97,47,61,53
61,13,29
97,13,75,29,47

keys in the map represent print numbers E:G 13,

The coorresponding array is the integers in the sequence which can come after it.

The issue here is that a given print sequence might just straight up miss a page in question.

So the first line is okay because all of the pages are present in the update

this makes a naive check against the list of permitted elements pointless... I'm braindead right now, do something different.
